# MNIST Digit Classification using Neural Networks

This repository contains a deep learning model built with *TensorFlow* and *Keras* to classify handwritten digits from the *MNIST* dataset. The model is trained using a simple neural network architecture, evaluated with accuracy metrics, and visualized using confusion matrices and other graphical representations.

## Overview

The *MNIST* dataset is a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) used for training and testing image classification models. This project demonstrates the following:

- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Building a feedforward neural network using *TensorFlow* and *Keras*.
- Evaluating the model's performance with various metrics.
- Visualizing the results with *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn*.

## Features

- *Model Architecture*: A simple neural network with fully connected layers.
- *Training*: 5 epochs of training using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.
- *Evaluation*: Test accuracy and per-class accuracy calculations.
- *Visualization*: 
    - Confusion matrix heatmap to visualize true vs. predicted labels.
    - Accuracy per digit class bar chart.
    - Displaying sample test images with predicted vs. true labels.
